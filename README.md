# Ad-Astra

Discord bot for weather forecast. Oriented for use in astronomy.

## Concept

This bot provides weather forecast for night, in order to prepare astronomical expeditions.
More specifically, it uses data collected from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org), analyze it, and produce summary reports for locations specified by the user. If the conditions are good enough for an expedition, it pings all users concerned.

## Features

- add/edit/delete different locations to add to the report
- customize the data included in the report
- customize the tolerance thresholds
- and a lot more to come
